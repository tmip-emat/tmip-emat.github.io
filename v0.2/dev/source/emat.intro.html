<h1>Introduction to EMAT<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction-to-emat" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>TMIP-EMAT is a methodological approach to exploratory modeling and analysis.
It provides a window to rigorous analytical methods for handling uncertainty
and making well informed decisions using travel forecasting models of all
types. It is designed to integrate with an <strong>existing transportation model</strong> or
tool to perform exploratory analysis of a range of possible scenarios.  In the
documentation of TMIP-EMAT, we refer to the existing model or tool as the
“core model”.</p>
<p>The core model should take a collection of inputs and generate one or more
outputs, or “performance metrics”, of interest.  Inputs can include variable
inputs (e.g., fuel cost) as well as model parameter inputs (e.g., the elasticity
of vehicle travel with respect to fuel cost).  Examples of a core model include,
but are not necessarily limited to the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Regional or statewide travel demand models</li>
<li>Activity-based travel models</li>
<li>Trip-based travel models</li>
<li>Sketch planning or spreadsheet model</li>
<li>Microsimulation models</li>
<li>Corridor-level travel model</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>TMIP-EMAT can be used to systematically explore uncertainties in input variables
and model parameters, and the impact that those uncertainties have on performance
metrics.  It is useful for examining model forecasts as a range of model outcomes
rather than a single outcome, and it provides a mechanism for defining
uncertainties and visualizing outputs.</p>
<p>TMIP-EMAT can also be used to understand how uncertainties interact with policy
decisions (e.g., extending a transit line), where <em>uncertainties</em> relate to model
inputs and variables that are outside of the policy-maker’s control, and policy
<em>levers</em> are model inputs that are within the policy-maker’s control.</p>
<p>If the existing tool or model is computationally expensive to run, TMIP-EMAT can
generate meta-models of the core model that describe how a set of model inputs
impact specific performance metrics.  These meta-models are formulated as
regression models of core model outputs that run very quickly (microseconds)
and allow model input uncertainties to be explored systematically while limiting
the number of computationally expensive core model runs.</p>
<div class="section" id="end-user-requirements">
<h2>End User Requirements<a class="headerlink" href="#end-user-requirements" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>First and foremost, an existing core model is required, and there should exist
a desire to explore the model systematically to better understand uncertainties
and their impact on potential future outcomes.</p>
<p>The core model should be <em>fully calibrated and validated</em> prior to integrating
with TMIP-EMAT.  Since TMIP-EMAT uses the core model as the basis for analysis,
any deficiencies with the core model will propagate to TMIP-EMAT results and
potentially lead the user to draw inappropriate conclusions.</p>
<p>The ability to run the core model programmatically, rather than manually, is
strongly recommended.  Although it is possible to conduct this kind of analysis
starting from manual operation of the core model, that process tends to be
error-prone, and automating the execution of the core model will both reduce
errors and increase overall modeling efficiency.</p>
<p>Deploying TMIP-EMAT on a programmatically executable core model requires the
existence or development of an application programming interface (API) to the
existing core model.  The API enables TMIP-EMAT to programmatically define
scenarios, launch and run the core model, retrieve errors and status, and
import metrics from the core model.  This API must also have a Python-facing
interface to connect with TMIP-EMAT, even if the core model itself does not
use Python.</p>
<p>Lastly, the core model should be directly sensitive to the policies under study,
or capable of being adjusted in some manner to be sensitive to those policies.
For example, a traditional travel demand model might be made sensitive to some
of the impacts of the introduction of autonomous cars though adjustments to
parameters for vehicle availability, highway capacity, or the value of in-vehicle
travel time.  On the other hand, making such a model sensitive to the introduction
of personal aerial vehicles might not be possible without major changes to the
basic structure of the model.</p>

<h2>Model Inputs, Outputs, and Configurations<a class="headerlink" href="#model-inputs-outputs-and-configurations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="inputs">
<h3>Inputs<a class="headerlink" href="#inputs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Core Model</strong>.
The core model is interfaced with TMIP-EMAT using an API.  The API enables
TMIP-EMAT to programmatically define scenarios, launch, retrieve errors and
status, and import metrics from the core model.  The API should allow for
configuration of all uncertainties and policy levers that are input to the
system as well as configuration of the desired performance metrics.  The
core model should be well-validated to ensure model sensitivities are
reasonable.</li>
<li><strong>Uncertainty Definitions</strong>.
Uncertainty definitions include the overall range, correlation, and
distribution of the risk variables that were selected for the analysis.
Uncertainties represent exogenous inputs to the core model that impact the
forecasts of the core model, and may include input variables, model
parameters, or model structures.  The set of uncertainties input to TMIP-EMAT
will typically be smaller than the full domain of inputs to the core model.
Uncertainties should be selected based on the importance of the variable in
the context of the scope of the analysis (considering policy levers and
metrics of interest) and the relative impact the variable has on relevant
performance metrics.</li>
<li><strong>Policy Lever Definitions</strong>.
Policy lever definitions include the specification of specific strategies/choices
to test in the analysis, including the range in potential lever options.
Levers (i.e., policy levers) represent inputs to the core model that impact
the model’s forecasts, but are controllable by planners or decision makers.
They can include individual variable inputs to the model (e.g., toll price)
or can represent a portfolio of changes to the model (e.g., a transit line
extension).</li>
<li><strong>Performance Metric Definitions</strong>.
The set of metrics that will be analyzed must be defined.  A performance
metric is an output of the core model and represents a gage by which the
impact of changes in uncertainties and levers can be measured.  Often core
models will have a large number of intermediate and final outputs that could
be considered here.  Metrics should be selected based on their relevance to
the analysis and for decision makers.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="outputs">
<h3>Outputs<a class="headerlink" href="#outputs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A primary output of TMIP-EMAT is a database of simulation runs of
the model, including the associated uncertainty and policy lever inputs for
each simulation and the performance metric outputs for each run.
TMIP-EMAT uses either a Monte Carlo or Latin Hypercube approach to sample across the uncertainty inputs
from their defined distributions and to sample across the potential values of
each lever.  For each simulation, the collection of model inputs is used along
with the core model (or meta-model representations of the core model) to generate
the set of performance metric outputs for that simulation.  The user has the
ability to specify the number of simulations that are performed.</li>
<li>The meta-models developed to describe the relationships between uncertainties,
levers, and metrics are themselves outputs of TMIP-EMAT (this only applies when
meta-models are used).  The meta-models serve as direct input to the EMA Workbench
to support guided exploratory analysis and can be useful for validating the core
model runs (e.g., to verify that model sensitivities to input variables and/or
parameters are reasonable and appropriate).</li>
<li>A variety of tools are built into TMIP-EMAT that can be used to generate
visualizations and tables to better understand the outputs.  Such tools include
the following:<ul>
<li>Risk Analysis Visualizations<ul>
<li>Tabulations of performance metrics can be generated showing percentile
ranges of each metric.  Tabulations can be segmented across different
values of levers included in the analysis.</li>
<li>Two-way scatter plots of model run results can be produced, showing
the impact of uncertainties on performance metrics for different policy
levers.</li>
<li>The relative importance/contribution of uncertainties to the overall
range in metrics can be plotted to gain an understanding for which
uncertainties carry the greatest impacts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Open-Ended Exploratory Analysis Visualizations<ul>
<li>Interactive tools are available in TMIP-EMAT to examine the relationships
between performance metrics and policy levers.  Interactive sliders and
toggle functions can be used to refine the exploratory analysis to
specific sets of simulation runs.</li>
<li>Conditional uncertainty distribution charts can be used to illustrate
the importance (or lack thereof) of uncertainty variables for achieving
specific targets in metrics under different policies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Guided Exploratory Analysis Visualizations<ul>
<li>Patient Rule Induction Method (<a class="reference internal" href="emat.glossary.html#term-prim"><span class="xref std std-term">PRIM</span></a>) tradeoff curves and
performance tabulations illustrate the number of
scenarios meeting specific performance metric criteria for scenario
discovery.</li>
<li>Other <a class="reference internal" href="emat.glossary.html#term-prim"><span class="xref std std-term">PRIM</span></a> visualizations indicate the restricted ranges of uncertainties
and levers that were identified by the algorithm.</li>
<li>Robust search outputs can be tabulated or plotted in parallel axis charts
to show the relationships between different policies and corresponding
objectives. Such visualizations illustrate the set of scenarios that represent
the Pareto optimal solutions to achieve a set of optimization criteria
specified by the user for the robust search algorithm.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="configurations">
<h3>Configurations<a class="headerlink" href="#configurations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>EMA Scoping File</strong>.
A single input configuration file is used to specify the configurations for each
TMIP-EMAT analysis.  The input configuration file uses a specific format to specify
the required inputs TMIP-EMAT, including the following:<ul>
<li>Uncertainty definitions.</li>
<li>Lever definitions.</li>
<li>Metric definitions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Guided Search Configurations</strong>.
A number of configurations must be set by the analyst when working with the guided
search tools, which are linked to the EMA Workbench.<ul>
<li><em>PRIM Configurations</em>.
PRIM requires that the analyst preselect a set of scenarios of interest.
The set of scenarios can be defined based upon any of the uncertainties,
levers, or metrics, though usually they are set based upon metrics to better
understand the inputs that result in a particular set of scenarios meeting
performance metric criteria.</li>
<li><em>Robust Search Configurations</em>.  Robust search requires several configurations,
including the following:<ul>
<li>Robustness metrics define the multi-criteria optimization, specifying the
set of metrics (or functions thereof) that should be optimized.</li>
<li>Constraints define criteria for which a metric must meet (rather than
be optimized).</li>
<li>The maximum number of iterations define stopping criteria for the
algorithm.</li>
<li>The number of scenarios define how many draws the algorithm uses of the
TMIP-EMAT model to perform the optimization.</li>
</ul>
