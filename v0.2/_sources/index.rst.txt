TMIP-EMAT documentation
=======================

TMIP-EMAT is a *methodological approach* to exploratory modeling and analysis.
It provides a window to rigorous analytical methods for handling uncertainty
and making well informed decisions using travel forecasting models of all
types. It is designed to integrate with an existing transportation model or
tool to perform exploratory analysis of a range of possible scenarios.

The methodologies demonstrated in this toolset build on and extend the
capabilities of the `EMA Workbench, version 2 <https://github.com/quaquel/EMAworkbench/tree/v2>`_.
A brief discussion of the differences between these projects is
:doc:`available <source/emat.vs.workbench>`.
